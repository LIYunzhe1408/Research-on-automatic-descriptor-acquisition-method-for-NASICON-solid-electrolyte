This local probe allows us to rule out the existence of segregated metal - rich nanoregions .
The mobility of Na at room temperature increases with the Na content .
The increase of Na mobility causes spatial disorder at the M site as deduced from the variable - temperature NPD study .
"At low temperatures , the activation energies do not change significantly ."
"The onset temperature for the curvature in the Z "" fma Arrhenius plots , when reaching the high - temperature regime , depends on sodium content ."
"The original NASICONs were solid solutions derived from NaZrzP by partial replacement of P by Si with Na excess to balance the negatively charged framework to yield the general formula Na + , ZrzP - , Si , ."
"Since then , a large number of related materials have been synthesized including the series Na , , MM ."
"Partial trivalent metal substitution at the octahedral metal site to give Na + + Zr - , M , has the NASICON structure , although the compositional limit , xma , , has been a matter of discussion ."

"Each XO , tetrahedron shares each corner with one MOs octahedron , and conversely , each MOs octahedron shares each corner with a different XO , group ."
The interstitial voids generated within the network are of two types known as M and M sites .
"An initial approach to correlate electrical parameters was followed by scrutiny of specific structural factors such as the size of the bottleneck that connects the M and M sites . """
"However , to establish possible correlations of this type , full crystal structure information is required ."
This may be obtained either by single - crystal diffraction or by Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data .

The calcined materials were then reground in a planetary ball mill for min and calcined at degree C for h . This last treatment was repeated twice to obtain homogeneous products .

Analysis of both types of spectra was carried out using the Bruker program WINFIT .
"The spinning rate and the position , line width , and intensity of components are determined automatically ."
Impedance data were collected on cylindrical pellets .
"The pellets were heated at degree C / min to degree C to remove organic matter , sintered at - degree C for h , and quenched to room temperature ."
"To reduce possible volatilization of soda , pellets were covered with powder of the same sample during sintering ."
The porosities estimated from the pellet mass and geometry were in the range - % .
Electrodes were made by coating opposite pellet faces with In - Ga alloy .
The impedance data were collected using a Hewlett - Packard A impedance analyzer over the frequency range from Hz to MHz .
The samples were studied from - to degree C at approximately degree C intervals .
The pellets were mounted in a conductivity jig whose leads were shielded separately inside a tube furnace or a Dewar .
"For low - temperature measurements , the samples were allowed to equilibrate for ~ h prior to measurements ; temperatures were accurate to + degree C ."

Initial XRPD data indicated that the members of this series for x < . are crystalline single phases which have the rhombohedral Rc NASICON : - type structure .
"The x = sample , NasInzs , was a mixture of a NASICON - type phase plus an alluaudite type phase and was not studied further ."
The crystal structures were refined by the Rietveld method using the structure of NaZras as starting model . '
The nominal Zr / In contents were assumed to be randomly distributed over the octahedral sites .
"It was also assumed , in the starting model , that there was full occupancy of the Na site at ."
"Then , the common overall parameters , scale factor , background coefficients , unit cell parameters , zero - shift error , and pseudo - Voigt coefficients , "" "" corrected for asymmetry , "" "" were optimized ."
"It became apparent , during an early stage of the refinements , that experimental peak intensities , especially those for In { and Injs , were not reproducible ."
This was due to the presence of large microparticle aggregates without random orientation .
"This method of preparation , for Ins and Ins , gave a highly uniform layer of small particles randomly distributed on a glass fiber filter substrate with reproducible XRPD peak intensities ."
"Once instrumental parameters had been taken into account , positional parameters were refined with the Zr / In ratios fixed at their expected values ."

These anomalously large values may be due to either spatial disorder or an occupancy lower than . .
Combined room temperature XRPD and NPD refinements for Injg and Injs showed that spatial disorder inside the M cavity was the main cause of the high temperature factors .
"Within two times the standard deviation , . % , full occupancy of the M site was obtained in these two combined room temperature refinements ."
"Finally , an isotropic temperature factor for each crystallographic framework site was refined ."
Rietveld analyses of the T - NPD data indicate the temperature at which positional disorder appears .

"In the NASICON structure , each tetrahedron shares oxygens with four octahedra , two in the same Mz ; unit and two in adjacent units ."
"On the basis of homogeneous statistical distribution of triand tetravalent cations , the five observed components can be assigned to P , environments ."
"The position of the P MAS NMR peaks depends on the polarizing strength of cations that share oxygens with the PO , tetrahedra ."
"Thus , strongly polarizing cations pull the electron density away from oxygens more effectively and cause the NMR peaks to shift to more negative values ."
The peaks occur at increasingly negative chemical shifts as the number of Zr neighbors increases .

"The fmax data show a gradual increase with x for a given temperature , indicating that the bulk conductivity increases with x ."

"The intensity ratios of each pair of adjacent bands in each sample , corrected for statistical multiplicities , are near to the / x values ."
This behavior indicates that the Zr / In distribution is nearly random and rules out the existence of nanoregions with different metal stoichiometries .
Sample compositions deduced from the NMR intensities agree with the nominal values .
"Hence , it can be concluded that the samples have the expected compositions and are chemically homogeneous ."
"However , the unit cell changes shape since a increases and c decreases with x ."
The present structural study allows us to explain these changes with x at an atomic level .
"On the basis of the structural data obtained by the Rietveld refinements , the anisotropic expansion can be rationalized as follows ."
"The decrease in c with x correlates with a decrease in intralantern P - O - M angles , from . degree for Ing to . degree for Ini . s , leading to a compression of the lanterns in the c direction ."
Interlantern P - O - M angles do not change appreciably .
The evolution of the degreeP MAS NMR bands along the series can be rationalized on the basis of these structural changes .
"The shifts in the degreeP peak positions for each set of bands have been Shannon , R . Sodium Mobility in Na + , Zr - In , ( POscorrelated with the variation of the P - O - M angles ."
"As the P - O - M angles between adjacent Zra show negligible variation , the shifts are ascribed to the changes of the intralantern P - O - M angles ."
A similar shift was detected in tectosilicates and assigned to the progressive modification of tetrahedral T - O - T angles of the network with AVSi substitution .
The filling of the M sites produces also a considerable modification of their oxygen environment .
"For Ing , the M sites are vacant and the void is very anisotropic with four long distances to O ."
"As this site is progressively filled , the environment becomes more regular : Na - O bond distances become shorter and Na - O distances larger ."
"For Ins , the distances are x . and x . A for O and x . and x . A for O ."
"The main structural change produced along the series is the movement of O toward the M site , which stretches the lanterns , causing the metal to displace from the center of the octahedron toward the O face ."
This results in an opening of the O - M - O angles and a closing of the P - O - M angles .
"At the same time , a small translation of the PO tetrahedra in the ab plane , far from the center of the lantern unit , takes place ."
"The more important degree of freedom , which adjusts along with the incorporation of Na on the M site , is the flexibility of the MOs octahedra , which distort by opening the O face , thus allowing these oxygens to move toward Na ."
The analysis of the structures show that the sizes and shapes of the bottlenecks connecting the M and M sites do not change significantly along the series .
XRPD refinements are not stable for Na displaced from the M site center .
"However , the room temperature combined NPD and XRPD refinements showed positional disorder at the M site and few if any cation vacancies ."
"The evolution of the thermally induced disorder of Na at M sites was analyzed indirectly by T - NPD by checking the U ; , , of Na at as a function of temperature ."
Thermal disorder starts approximately above K for Ings and above K for In .
The temperature dependence of this activation is sharp for Inj & and smoother and larger for the Ings sample .
"U ; , , thermal variation of Na at M , for both samples , is by comparison much smaller ."
"With the limited range of the NPD data and the anomalously very high U ; , , values for Na at M above K , it is not possible to confirm full occupancy of M at T > K . So , either more extensive Na spatial disorder or vacancy creation or both may occur at T ' > K . For Inog and Ing , two signals are needed to explain the patterns recorded at room temperature ."
"The signal at - ppm with = is assigned to Na at the center of M site , but the second signal at - ppm with = . must be ascribed to structural sites of lower symmetry ."
"Mater . , Vol , No , . , exchange of Na between the structural sites is detected ."
"As a consequence , a unique "" envelope "" with an intermediate pattern is measured ."
"The averaged signal sharpens with increasing x , indicating an increase in sodium mobility ."
"For x > . , NMR components are narrower , indicating the existence of some residual mobility for Na at K . The signal measured at room temperature at - ppm does not correspond to any of these signals , and hence , it must be ascribed to a third sodium site ."
Occupation of these sites must be associated with the thermal spatial disorder detected in the combined NPD and XRPD Rietveld studies .
"These sites , out of the center of the M cavity and near to the structural MM bottleneck , could minimize the electrostatic repulsion between contiguously occupied M and M sites ."
"However , for high sodium mobilities , this signal cannot be detected , as rapid Na exchange masks signals of different sites ."
"The low - temperature "" "" Na MAS NMR study has confirmed the existence of sodium mobility for all compositions at room temperature and the mobility increases considerably for x > . ."
"The electrical microstructure of the samples is complex , in part due to their incomplete sintering and densification ."
A thick constriction region between adjacent grains dominates overall conductivities .
"Nevertheless , the temperature and composition dependence of the bulk response can be obtained readily from the M "" peak maximum and compared with that of the overall pellet The Arrhenius plots for the overall conductivities in the series do not show a clear trend ."
"However , the M "" data fall on a set of wellspaced approximately parallel lines showing a clear trend of increasing bulk conductivities with x . Conductivities increase by almost orders of magnitudes along the series ."
"Therefore , the variation in the M f . , , , data with x must be mainly attributed to variations in carrier concentration ."
"An increase in overall conductivity with x has already been reported . """
"Hence , when the pellet sintering is not satisfactory , the Arrhenius plot of M "" f . , , , gives a good indication of the bulk response of the sample ."
"Some insights into the similarities and differences between the bulk and thick grain boundary regions are obtained from a comparison of the frequency of the maximun of M "" and Z "" , fm - x , versus / ."
"Three samples , representative of the behavior of the series , are shown in Figure ."
"Due to the frequency limitations of the impedance equipment , M "" fmax data were obtained over only a limited range of lower temperatures , whereas much more extensive data sets were obtained for Z "" fmax ."
"M "" fmax data occur at - orders of magnitude higher than corresponding Z "" fmax data but are essentially parallel for the temperatures over which both M "" and Z "" data were obtained ."
"The parallel behavior of the M "" , Z "" plots at lower temperatures shows that the conduction mechanism and the Chem ."

"It is well - established that even in single crystals , the Z "" peaks always occur at lower frequencies than corresponding M "" peaks ."
"In extreme cases , such as Na B - alumina crystals , the peak separation may be orders of magnitude ; more commonly peak separations are often about . - order of magnitude ."
"The origin of the peak separations lies in the conduction mechanisms and the fact that the electrical response cannot be represented by simple , ideal , frequency - independent RC elements , but additional , frequency dependent admittances , or constant phase elements , are necessary in order to adequately model the experimental data ."
"The curvature in the Z "" y , « Arrhenius plots is of the kind widely seen in materials with high ionic conductivity ."
"At higher temperatures , the Z "" data show curvature toward a region of lower activation energy ."
"The explanation usually given is that , at lower temperatures , some defect clustering or local ordering of the mobile ions occurs , leading to an increase in the activation energy for conduction ."
The variable - temperature NPD study shows the development of a strong cation spatial disorder at the M site over the temperature range where the curvature is observed .
Both phenomena are likely related as the relative destabilization of Na at M with temperature is probablyLosilla et alresponsible for decreasing the activation energy .
The onset of the new regime slightly depends on the Na content as it occurs at lower temperatures as x increases .
The existence of two regimes with different sodium mobilities agrees with the NMR results .
"The Na M sublattice "" melting "" decreases the activation energy as the relative destabilization of that site is essential for ionic conductivity ."
Charge carriers have to jump through the M site in order to migrate .
"The structure responds to the incorporation of Na on the M site by moving the O atoms toward those sites , reflecting the flexibility of the MOs octahedra ."
"At room temperatures , Na mobility increases with Na content ; for x = . , the Na cations are rather localized , but for x > . compositions , important mobility gave a single line with averaged characteristics ."
"The Arrhenius plots for the overall conductivites did not show a systematic trend but the plots of the M "" fmax data showed a clear increase of bulk conductivities with x . T - NPD showed spatial disorder of Na at the M site above ~ K . The low - temperature activation energies change very little with x , in agreement with negligible variation of the bottleneck size ."
"So , the observed increase of conductivity with x is due to an increase in charge carrier concentration ."
"The observed curvature in the Z "" fmax Arrhenius plots , likely related to the strong thermal disorder of Na at the M site , indicates the existence of two regimes with different sodium motion in the series ."
