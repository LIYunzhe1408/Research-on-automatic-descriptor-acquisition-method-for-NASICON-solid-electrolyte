IntroductionThe increasing interest in solid - state sodium batteries has made deeper understanding of the involved materials a necessary requirement .
"Due to a wide range of structural stability and excellent electrical performance , NaSICONs have the potential to be used as electrolytes in solid - state batteries ."
"However , for successful application in batteries , their mechanical properties and the thermal expansion behavior must also be studied in order to avoid thermal stresses and assure thermally stable cathode - electrolyte contact to avoid micro - cracking at the interface ."
"Thermal expansion is represented by its coefficient , and it can be obtained using different experimental techniques ."
High - temperature X - ray diffraction is the most reliable technique to measure the CTE at the crystallographic unit cell level where the lattice expansion is determined as a function of temperature .
"As an example , the NaSICON material NaSc - , but a substantial expansion of the c lattice parameter of . % between room temperature and degree C ."
"The resulting CTEs are . x K ~ ' and . x ~ degree K respectively , leading to a mean CTE of . x K ~ ' ."
"The anisotropy is a crucial material property , as it results in residual stresses during cooling after sintering and thus induces micro - cracks , reduces the electrical conductivity , and increases safety risks ."
This is particularly true for materials with crystal anisotropy and depends also on the microstructure .
"In addition , the formation of micro - cracks also erases the results of CTE measurements by dilatometry ."
"In this case , the dimensional change of samples is measured mechanically using a pressure - sensitive push - rod or optically with a laser system ."
"Since CTE determination from dilatometry uses the macroscopic dimensional change , it therefore also includes changes in microstructure ."
A careful sample preparation combined with sensitive and well - calibrated measurements may result in accurate CTEs from dilatometry similar to HT - XRD even for polycrystalline materials .
"For example , the CTE of dense mol % yttria - stabilized zirconia is . x K ~ ' and . x K - !"
"when measured with dilatometry and HT - XRD , respectively ."
"In NaSICON materials , often the CTEs from dilatometry are much smaller than the values obtained from HT - XRD , which results from the creation of cracks , particularly during the cooling step after sintering ."
"These cracks become narrower and disappear during dilatometry measurements , because of volume expansion while heating ."
"This often leads to CTE values smaller than the data derived from crystallographic measurements and , even worse , the sometimes negative slope of the dilatometry curves triggered an intense research activity and led to the misinterpretation that NaSICON materials might be "" zero - expansion "" ceramics ."
"As shown in Figure , the CTE measurements on Na ; Zr > Si , P _ , O ; only show an acceptable agreement between HT - XRD and dilatometry for x > . ."
"Typically , a hysteresis in the cooling and heating curves of dilatometry indicates the influence of micro - cracks ."
Only a careful sample preparation results in a crack - free material to achieve CTE values that are in good agreement with XRD data .

ExperimentalAll specimens were prepared from powder precursors by uniaxial pressing MPa into a rectangular shape and subsequent sintering at - degree C . The terminal faces were cut and polished to give samples mm in length .
The synthesis of the powders and more details on sample preparation and sintering conditions are given elsewhere .
Sintered samples with density in the range of - % were used to measure the length changes as a function of temperature to determine the CTE .
"In a temperature range AT , a sample with a reference length Lo has a length change AL , and its CTE is calculated according to : The dilatometry experiments were carried out with a push - rod dilatometer C from Netzsch , Germany , calibrated with a sapphire single crystal ."
Temperature was calibrated using an interpolation routine with five standard metals after determination of their melting points .
"Each sample was heated with K / h to degree C , and then the temperature was kept constant for . h to control the dimensional stability of the specimens ."
"Finally , the samples were cooled with - K / h to degree C . For comparison with HT - XRD results , the crystallographic unit cell parameters Hence , the CTE calculations using Equations and assume that the macroscopic body behaves like a single crystal ."
"Results and DiscussionsThe dilatometry measurements of the series NAYZSiP , during heating is shown in Figure ."
"The dilatometry curves indicate a small change in slope between and degree C , which corresponds to a monoclinic to thombohedral phase transition ."
The transition temperature decreases with increasing the substitution content until x = . .
"As shown in Figure a , the transition temperatures can be easily obtained from the first derivative of the dilatometry curves , better showing the slope changes ."
Additional slope changes at higher temperatures are also visible in Figure .
"The straight dashed lines indicate the deviation from a linear thermal expansion and show , on the one hand , that the additional expansion increases with increasing x , and , on the other hand , that the onset temperature of the additional expansion decreases with increasing x ."
The slope changes at high temperatures are summarized in Figure b and consist of two contributions which both tend to decrease in temperature with increasing x .
The onset temperatures and maxima of slope changes are listed in Table .
"In addition , in this temperature region , secondary phase formation is observed by HT - XRD measurements ."
"Batteries , , of ALMLy % T / CFigure ."
Solid lines represent measured data that deviates from linear behavior .
"Therefore this change in slope at high temperatures could be due to secondary phase segregation processes , and , especially for the samples with x > . , the formation of new phases as observed in HT - XRD measurements ."
"It is , therefore , interesting to note that the substituting elements show a low solubility in the NaSICON structure at degree C and below , whereas they are widely incorporated in the host lattice at sintering temperatures of - degree C . In this period , the samples elongate very systematically with an individual constant rate which is proportional to the substitution level ."

The used parameters and resulting CTEs are also listed in Table and show that especially small amounts of AIPO may have a significant impact on the thermal expansion of a polycrystalline NaSICON material .
"Therefore , the small impurities easily explain the larger CTEs obtained from dilatometry although the opposite trend might be expected ."

"The values of the high - temperature processes have an error of about + degree C . In the case of NaSICON materials , often the CTEs obtained from dilatometry are much smaller than the ones from HT - XRD ."
"This is because the particles expand anisotropically , leading to creation of cracks during cooling after sintering originating from large grain sizes ."
"Subsequently , during the dilatometry measurements , these cracks are reversibly filled up by the surrounding expanding material , and consequently , the detected length changes of the sample are smaller than a crack - free material ."
"However , a careful sample preparation can result in similar CTE values obtained from dilatometry and HT - XRD ."

"This is because at higher temperature , sodium ions become highly mobile , induce increased repulsive forces , and therefore increase the vibrational magnitude within the lattice ."
"On the other hand , the substitution with trivalent transition metal cations also influences the CTE of the NaSICON material ."
"This is validated by the calculations of the volume of ZrQs and ScQ octahedra , i e , . A ?"
"As a consequence of enlarged octahedra with central trivalent cations , the lattice vibrations become more pronounced , especially at elevated temperatures ."
"This explains why the CTE of NAYZSiP , and other NaSICON compounds substituted with trivalent cations are increasing much more in dependence of x than NaSICON materials with tetravalent cations ."

"ConclusionsThe coefficients of thermal expansion coefficient of the NaSICON series NAYZSiP , were measured by dilatometry ."
The CTE values were similar to those obtained by HT - XRD .
The prerequisite for accurate dilatometry measurements is a careful sample preparation for achieving crack - free specimens .
The CTEs of NaSICON materials increase with Na content per formula unit when Zr ' is used as transition metal cation in the polyanionic lattice .
This is because sodium influences the charge polarization and therefore induces stronger lattice vibrations due to increased repulsive forces within the lattice .
"In addition , the substitution of trivalent transition metal cations influences the CTE because Batteries , , of they have weaker attractive forces towards oxygen atoms of the octahedra as compared to tetravalent cations , which also leads to higher lattice vibrations ."
