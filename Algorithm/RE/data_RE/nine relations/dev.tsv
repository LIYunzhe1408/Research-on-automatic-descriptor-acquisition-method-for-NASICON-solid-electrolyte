Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The small excess of <e1>sodium</e1> ( <e2>0.11 atoms per formula unit</e2> ) is located in the Na2 site , which is a poorly constrained , irregular site at a general position .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Consequently , the successive sodium jumps between sites resulting in the static lattice potential , Na ( l ) Na(2) Na ( l ) , via the shallow potential mid-Na site imply a breathing like movement of the framework in perfect agreement with the <e1>dynamic tetrahedra </e1><e2>disorder</e2> observed in these crystals .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	It is worth pointing out that the <e1>intercalation rate</e1> of sodium x , in NaxNb2P3O12 is rather low compared of other <e2>nasicon oxides</e2> , for which is generally equal or greater than one .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	As previously observed ( 14 ) for the first crystal structure determination of the NASICON , further calculations reveal , for crystals in the composition range 2 < x < 2.4 , the occupation of a third <e1>sodium</e1> position within the conduction path , approximately halfway between ideal Na(1) and <e2>Na(2)</e2> positions ( 1.8 from each one ) .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	It is shown that <e1>Na3TiP3O9N</e1> can reversibly cycle Na - ions in a manner suitable for secondary batteries , and that the <e2>volume changes</e2> on Naremoval are remarkably small ( < 1 % ) relative to other known Na - ion battery systems and offer unique advantages toward the development of Na - ion systems with extended lifetimes .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Excellent thermal stability is observed for both pristine Na3TiP3O9N and desodiated <e1>Na2TiP3O9N</e1> , suggesting that this phase can serve as a safe <e2>Na - ion battery electrode</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Moreover , it is expected that further optimization of the general cubic framework of Na3TiP3O9N by <e1>chemical substitution</e1> will result in <e2>thermostable solid state electrolytes</e2> with isotropic conductivities that can function at temperatures near or just above room temperature .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The measured room temperature ionic conductivity of Na3TiP3O9N is substantial ( 4 - 10(-)S / cm ) , though both the <e1>strong temperature dependence</e1> of <e2>Na ion thermal parameters</e2> and the observed activation energy of 0.54 eV suggest that much higher ionic conductivities can be achieved with minimal heating .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	3 : 1 Na3TiP3O9N should have much higher <e1>Na - ion mobility</e1> than 2 : 2 <e2>Na2Fe2P3O9N</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	It is demonstrated that Na ions are mobile at room temperature in the nitridophosphate compound Na3TiP3O9N , with a <e1>diffusion pathway</e1> that is calculated to be fully three dimensional and <e2>isotropic</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	When <e1>Na3TiP3O9N</e1> is fully desodiated to produce Na2TiP3O9N using a <e2>chemical oxidant</e2> , this framework still remains stable against oxidation in O2 up to at least 400 <nUm> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Although the capacity of Na3TiP3O9N is somewhat limited ( 74 mAh / g ) for practical cathode applications , this CUBICON framework contains two readily mobile Na ions ( and three Na ions in total ) per transition metal site , so the theoretical capacity of this framework can be doubled or even tripled if <e1>transition metals</e1> such as V3+ ( V4+ , V5+ ) or Cr3+ ( <e2>Cr4+</e2> , Cr5+ , Cr6+ ) that can access more than two oxidation states are substituted for Ti3+ .

Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>Na+ </e1>mobility within the <e2>Na3TiP3O9N</e2> CUBICON structure was first studied by dc polarization measurements on sintered pellets ( ~ 85 % dense ) of Na3TiP3O9N with gold blocking electrodes .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The structure consists of a <e1>three dimensional skeletal network</e1> of <e2>PO tetrahedra</e2> corner - sharing with Zr06 octahedra , the Na ions occupying a large octahedral site in the interstitial space .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	By single crystal diffraction experiments at high temperatures combined with <e1>ac conductivity measurements</e1> we can decide wether the bulk or the domain wall <e2>diffusion model</e2> is valid : If the bulk diffusion process is the main one and if the temperature is high enough , the diffusion path should be describable with the propability density function of the Na ions ( PDF ( r ) ) .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The structural evidence for displacement of Na ions toward bottleneck positions in <e1>Na3Zr ~ Si ~ PO12</e1> indicates that this is the case , and indeed the <e2>transport properties</e2> at 30 <nUm> are comparable to those of the best .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The 3D Na - ion conduction pathways , good sodium ionic conductivity , extremely small volume changes , high redox potential ( 0.6 V higher than equivalent Ti4+ / Ti3+ redox couple of NASICON type Na3Ti2(PO4)3 cathodes ) , and good <e1>thermal stability</e1> make this <e2>structure type</e2> particularly attractive for rechargeable Na ion battery applications .

Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Furthermore , the combination of the <e1>Mn3+</e1> / Mn2+ and Ti4+ / Ti3+ redox couples in <e2>Na3MnTi(PO4)3</e2> would enable the symmetric battery to possess a high output voltage of approximately 1.4 V .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The <e1>cell parameter</e1> evolution along the series agrees with the substitution of larger Ti4+ by smaller <e2>Al3+ cations</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Wei et al. designed <e1>hierarchicalcarbon - coated</e1> m-LVP mesoporous nanowires that showed a high capacity of 117 mA h g at 10 <nUm> and excellent <e2>cycling stability</e2> of 80 % capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 5 <nUm> between 3 and 4.3 V vs Li / Li .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Also , significantly higher <e1>voltages</e1> are expected when other trivalent transition metals are substituted for <e2>Ti3+</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	However , on the other hand it also can be interpreted as experimental uncertainty of the <e1>sodium content</e1> , because a very small change of charge carriers can cause a huge variation in <e2>conductivity</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As the number of <e1>charge carriers</e1> increases , so too does the conductivity , until a maximum concentration is reached , corresponding either to the half - filled occupancy of the Na sites or a structural change resulting in a <e2>steric barrier</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In NSSiPx , the maximal amount of Na per formula unit is 4 mol and the highest <e1>conductivity</e1> is achieved around 3.12 mol which represents a ratio of occupied <e2>Na sites</e2> over vacant Na sites of approximately 80 / 20 : the conductivity increases with the amount of charge carriers but at least 20 % of the charge carrier positions have to be vacant .

Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Indeed , both the <e1>Na concentration</e1> and the size of the M cations determine the properties of a <e2>NASICON material</e2> and only when both parameters are simultaneously at the optimum value , the conductivity will be high .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>sodium content</e1> is grouped in three classes of which the compositions with 2.5 < = Na / mol < = 3.5 show the <e2>highest conductivity</e2> values .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Among all rechargeable battery technologies , <e1>Li - ion cells</e1> have the largest energy density and output voltage today , but they have yet to be optimized in terms of capacity , <e2>safety</e2> and cost for use as stationary systems .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Accordingly , powders of <e1>NaZr2PQO 12</e1> and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 were held for four hours in molten LiN03 , <e2>AgN03</e2> , and KN3 , respectively .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	( 6 ) Whereas B-alumina has an anisotropic thermal expansion , pseudocubic Na3Zr2Si2PO12 may have a nearly isotropic thermal expansion , thus minimizing <e1>thermally</e1> induced stresses at <e2>grain boundaries</e2> of a ceramic membrane .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	More recently , Boilot et al. found in a variable temperature single crystal study of the stoichiometric NASICON , <e1>Na3Zr2Si2PO12</e1> , an extra sodium position located in the conduction channel between <e2>Na(1)</e2> and Na(2) of the high temperature ( 350 <nUm> ) rhombohedral structure .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	In contrast to <e1>MMo2P3O12</e1> ( M = Tl , Rb , K ) which adopt a tunnel structure and are built of Mo2O11 units , <e2>P2O7 groups</e2> and PO4 tetrahedra , the sodium compound has a markedly different structure and is composed of MoO6 octahedra , NaO6 trigonal antiprisms , and PO4 tetrahedra .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Because the energy of hybridization at a Ag+ ion is comparable to the increased covalent - bond energy made possible in oxides by hybridization , the <e1>Ag-O bond length</e1> may vary over quite a range from <e2>compound</e2> to compmmd .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The PO4 tetrahedra and the <e1>Yb octahedra</e1> form a <e2>three dimensional skeleton</e2> in which the remaining sodium atoms are inserted .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Whereas alumina has an an<e1>isotropic thermal expansion</e1> , pseudocubic <e2>Na3Zr2Si2P012</e2> may have a nearly isotropic thermal expansion , thus minimizing thermally ilXh-1ced stresses at grain boundaries of a ceramic membrane .
Method-Of(e1,e2)	XRD , FTIR , <e1>TG - DTA</e1> and SEM / TEM techniques confirm the <e2>phase formation</e2> of the material .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>Na(2')-O(1') bond distances</e1> show no temperature correlations and fall within 3 esd 's of the average <e2>Na(2)-O distance</e2> for all the refinements .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	The maximum of the average length of the Na(1) oxygen bond and <e1>the maximum of the c hexagonal parameter</e1> , observed at about <e2>x = 2</e2> , are clearly associated with the minimum value of Na(1) occupation factor .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The maximum of the average length of the Na(1) oxygen bond and <e1>the maximum of the c hexagonal parameter</e1> , observed at about x = 2 , are clearly associated with <e2>the minimum value of Na(1) occupation factor</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Since all members ofthe family should , in principle , form <e1>crystalline solutions</e1> , a wide range of anisotropy and a <e2>nearzero thermal expansion composition</e2> should be possible .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The crystallite size is decided mainly by two factors i.e. adiabatic flame temperature and <e1>number of moles</e1> of gases released during combustion . The flame temperature and the number of moles of gases released are more for large <e2>fuel ratio</e2> .

Method-Of(e2,e1)	Commonly , <e1>the optimisation of reaction parameters</e1> is performed by sequential unit operations , such as transfer of liquids , <e2>quenching</e2> of the reaction and storage of the samples prior to analysis .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The present study shows that grain and total <e1>conductivity</e1> decreases with fuel ratio and is quite dependable on the material 's <e2>density</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Improved conductivity is elucidated by least size and highest density of the <e1>crystallites</e1> , which in turn is decided by the <e2>flame temperature</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The first observed <e1>phase transformation</e1> leads to an abrupt change in the electrical conductivity , whereas the second is marked by an in flection on the curve giving the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and by a decrease in its <e2>activation energy</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Outside ( 0 x 1.8 and 2.4 < x < 3 ) the <e1>solid solutions</e1> show rather poor ionic conductivity and have <e2>rhombohedral symmetry</e2> already at room temperature .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	<e1>NASICON structured materials</e1> are particularly attractive because they exhibit great <e2>structural stability</e2> , as well as fast ionic conductivity .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	To compete with a <e1>liquid electrolyte</e1> , the <e2>ionic conductivity</e2> of a solid electrolyte should be about 10(-2) S cm(-1) at room temperature .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	This <e1>ionic conductivity</e1> is quite substantial , and it is likely that the framework ionic conductivity can be enhanced considerably by the intentional introduction of Na vacancies , or by substitutions on the <e2>transition metal</e2> site .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Electrochemical intercalation or reaction with <e1>organometallic</e1> should allow the <e2>sodium content</e2> to be increased .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This is a consequence of the thermal stability of the material as it can not be <e1>heated</e1> above 800 <nUm> without partial <e2>decomposition</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Both end of which can take part in complexation of <e1>metal ions</e1> of varying sizes , which helps in preventing selective <e2>precipitation</e2> to maintain compositional homogeneity among the constituents .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The most significant consequence of the difference in the <e1>spatial arrangement</e1> of polyhedra is the number of cavities formed in the framework and their <e2>shape</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	<e1>The deviations of the dependences of unit cell parameters from the Vegard's rule</e1> are appar ently due to the flexibility of the structure framework and <e2>distortion of the anion packing of the solid solution</e2> as compared with the anion packing in the pure components .
Other	Different preparation techniques exist to reduce the size of crystallites ; among those hydrothermal , sol gel and <e1>co-precipitation</e1> are commonly used for <e2>NASICON synthesis</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Correlations are found between the structural distortion and electrical conductivity of the <e1>phosphates</e1> , on one hand , and the <e2>alkali cation</e2> size , on the other .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Little change occurs in bond distances and <e1>angles</e1> in the (Zr2Si3O12)-4 framework whereas the Na(1)-O6 and <e2>Na(2)-O8 polyhedra</e2> enlarge dramatically with increase of temperature .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The overall <e1>conductivities</e1> increase with x but it is hard to discuss this variation as the porosities and <e2>grain boundary</e2> contributions are different along the series .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>monoclinic structure</e1> of their <e2>crystals</e2> would also indicate that x is greater than 1.24 ; at least x = 1.6 is required to achieve the monoclinic structure ( 7 ) .

Condition-On(e1,e2)	The <e1>disorder</e1> is larger at <e2>100 K</e2> than at 295 K .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>thermal expansion</e1> of the crystallographic a-axis is two times larger than that of the <e2>c-axis</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	In the course of a systematic investigation of the electronic and <e1>chemical properties</e1> of compounds with the <e2>Nb3X4 structure</e2> the TlxTi6Se8 system has been synthesized in a wide homogeneity range ( 0.23 < x < 0.8 ) .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	The only known fact about the structure was that the <e1>c-glide plane</e1> , present above the transition point , is lost in the <e2>low temperature form</e2> .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	The component of the rotation of the <e1>edge O12 - O12</e1> in the phosphate group out of the ( 2110 ) <e2>plane</e2> is very small , but that of the edge O21 - O22 , around the [0001] direction is big .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This O(1) movement counteracts the <e1>M-O bond</e1> decrease which results in a very small variation of the <e2>a-axis</e2> along the series .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Nevertheless , it is notable that the <e1>occupancy</e1> of the O ( 1 ' ) site reaches an apparent minimum at a value that is equal , within experimental error , to the occupancy of the <e2>Na(2' ) Site</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Given the low occupancy of this <e1>site</e1> , the variation in <e2>thermal parameters</e2> , and the general limitations of the Rietveld technique , it is difficult to assess the importance of this trend .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As the <e1>temperature</e1> is increased , O(1') moves away from O(1 ) while at the same time , the occupancy of <e2>O( 1' ) diminishes</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	However , the refined populations of <e1>Na(2' )</e1> and O(1) are such that their sum is less than 100 % at all temperatures studied , so the disorder between O(1) and <e2>O(1' )</e2> may preclude the presence of such an unfavorable interaction in the structure .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Moreover , there is an apparent interaction between <e1>Na(2' )</e1> and <e2>O(1)</e2> of ca. 2.1 , significantly shorter than the 2.4 predicted for 6-coordinate sodium from ionic radii .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The expansion in the c direction , that is +0.652A , isduein +0.686A to the <e1>rotations</e1> and distortions in the <e2>PO4 group</e2> and in -0.034A to the face to face distance contraction of the TiO6 octahedron .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	More interesting is that the Na ( l ) occupation and obviously the <e1>mid-Na occupation</e1> are clearly related to the variations in <e2>conductivity</e2> with composition .
Method-Of(e2,e1)	which suggests that the observed stoichiometric differences can be attributed to the different paths by which each <e1>NASICON</e1> was prepared : high temperature solid state reaction , hydrothermal , or <e2>sol gel procedure</e2> ( 13 ) .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	recorded and assignments of the <e1>As - O</e1> stretching and <e2>bending modes</e2> were made .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	This indicates a change of <e1>lattice parameters</e1> to conform to the size of a new tetrahedral unit , <e2>(P,As)-O4</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As well as <e1>charge carrier concentration</e1> , structural properties are also important factors in determining <e2>electric conductivities</e2> .
Method-Of(e1,e2)	One of the authors had calculated its thermal <e1>expansion</e1> ( 2 ) from room temperature up to 500 <nUm> , finding a negative <e2>thermal expansion coefficient</e2> of -5.5 x 10 -6 <nUm> C-1 by dilatometry , and a strong anisotropy , from high temperature X ray diffraction , with coefficients a(a) = -5.61 x 10 -6 <nUm> -1 ( 25 <nUm> to 500 <nUm> ) and a(c) = 12.8 x 10 -6 <nUm> -1 ( 25 <nUm> to 200 <nUm> ) and 28.1 x 10 -6 <nUm> C-1 ( 200 <nUm> to 500 <nUm> ) showing a deflection in the expansion along the hexagonal c axis .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	It has been shown that the first <e1>phase transformation</e1> in the range 40 - 60 <nUm> is accompanied by an increase in the <e2>density</e2> and a change to the space group Rc .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>bottlenecks</e1> of diffusion lie within the faces of the <e2>NaO 6- octahedra</e2> .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Each XO4 tetrahedron shares each <e1>corner</e1> with one MO6 octahedron and , conversely , each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different <e2>XO4 group</e2>
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Each <e1>XO4 tetrahedron</e1> shares each <e2>corner</e2> with one MO6 octahedron and , conversely , each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different XO4 group
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The mean thermal expansion coefficient , as defined by Cameron ef al. ( 16 ) is 0.52 x 10 <nUm> C-1 for the ZrO6 octahedron and <e1>0.33 x 10 <nUm> C-1</e1> for the <e2>SiO4 tetrahedron</e2> .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>mean thermal expansion coefficient</e1> , as defined by Cameron ef al. ( 16 ) is 0.52 x 10 <nUm> C-1 for the ZrO6 octahedron and 0.33 x 10 <nUm> C-1 for the <e2>SiO4 tetrahedron</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Because the <e1>Na2 site</e1> is special , only x ( o ) , 14 <e2>anisotropic temperature coefficients</e2> and the occupancy had to be refined .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The large thermal expansion of the sodium site is offset by <e1>rotations</e1> in the <e2>Zr-P polyhedral framework</e2> , thus yielding the low net expansion of NZP .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This <e1>rotation</e1> acts to increase the height of the <e2>Na(1) octahedra</e2> and is responsible for the anomalous maximum in the length of the c axis .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Therefore , as a function of the composition , small thermal changes are observed along the <e1>c axis</e1> and the variation of the volume <e2>expansion</e2> is essentially due to changes along the a axis .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The <e1>zirconium octahedron</e1> ( point symmetry 3) contains three Zr-Ol bonds of 2.041 A and three <e2>Zr-O2 bonds</e2> of 2.094 A ( Table III ) .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	A fit of Rw(F) / R(F) = 0.019 / O.020 were attained when the Nal site and the <e1>oxygen sites</e1> were refined with additional higher order <e2>temperature factor coefficients</e2> ( TABLE III ) .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	me research reported here was motivated by active interest in <e1>solid electrolytes</e1> having fast <e2>alkali ion</e2> transport and by the proposition ( l ) that solid electrolytes having alkali ion conductivities approaching those of liquids should occur in skeleton structures .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Furthermore , the <e1>electrochemical performance</e1> can also be greatly improved by doping , shortening the ion - diffusion pathway , and by <e2>carbon coating</e2> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	<e1>The companion cation of the network</e1> can have a <e2>tetrahedral site</e2> preference or an octahedral site preference .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	However , when the <e1>temperature</e1> increases , the <e2>Na ( l ) site occupancy</e2> slightly increases to the detriment of the mid-Na one and the mid-Na position slightly moves to the Na(2) position .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Atom <e1>Na(2)</e1> is 8-coordinate with regular <e2>Na-O bond distances</e2> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	<e1>Atom Na(2)</e1> is <e2>8-coordinate with regular Na-O bond distances </e2>, By contrast Na(2f) is in 6-fold coordination consisting of atoms and two atoms .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	For the refinement of the 403K data <e1>anharmonic temperature factors</e1> ( 6 ) have been used up to third order for <e2>Na(2)</e2> and up to fourth or der for Na(1) .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	This set of semicircles indicates that several effects are involved in the <e1>electrical response</e1> of the pellets , including bulk and <e2>grain boundary</e2> contributions .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Therefore , only the total <e1>resistance</e1> , RTotal , as a sum of bulk and <e2>grain boundary</e2> phenomena was deduced from the impedance plot .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	They observed that the opening of <e1>bottleneck</e1> increases when the <e2>temperature</e2> is raised , which is associated with the decrease of the potential barrier and the increase of the hexagonal c parameter .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The changes in area of the T1 triangle ( as simplification to define the irregular M1M2 <e1>bottleneck</e1> ) correlate with variations in <e2>MAS NMR</e2> data and in the ionic conductivity properties with composition .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	The appearance of three reflections at <e1>2 = 19.5 <nUm></e1> and two reflections at 2 = 28 <nUm> are characteristic for the presence of the <e2>monoclinic phase</e2> in the powder .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	High symmetry form of these compounds has a greater <e1>volume</e1> of large cation site and this volume can be reduced to a critical size for <e2>phase transformation</e2> by a reduction in temperature or increase in pressure or by substitution with a smaller alkali cation .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	Typically , the <e1>transition</e1> from the <e2>low - temperature phase</e2> to the high - temperature phase occurs around 400 C ~ 200 C and depends on the composition .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Concerning the <e1>fivefold coordinated mid-Na interstitial site</e1> , there is a relatively short average <e2>sodium - oxygen distance</e2> with participation of three oxygens of a face of the Na06 octahedron ( generally considered as the geometrical bottleneck for the diffusion ) and of two oxygens neighboring Na(2) sites .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>AsO4 tetrahedra</e1> are quite regular with an average As-O distance of 1.668 A which is lower than the value of 1.735 A estimated from the <e2>effectiveionic radii</e2> of four coordinated As(5+) and O(2) .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Each Na2 or Na3 site is connected through a bottleneck to two <e1>Na1 sites</e1> , but there is no <e2>passageway</e2> between Na2 sites or a Na2 and a Na3 site .
Instance-Of(e2,e1)	Additional refinement of higher order temperature coefficients of the Na sites at 993K yielded a <e1>Na diffusion path</e1> Na1 - <e2>Na2</e2> similar to that found in other NASICON compositions .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	After refinement of a basic model and an accurate definition of the atom positions , the <e1>occupancy</e1> of Na1 and <e2>Na2 sites</e2> were refined freely and were finally restrained to meet the criterion for charge balance .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	As this <e1>site</e1> is progressively filled , the environment becomes more regular , Table 3 , Na(2)-O(1) bond distances become shorter and <e2>Na(2)-O(2) distances</e2> larger .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Analysis of the IR spectra of the single <e1>phase vanadate phosphate samples</e1> indicated the presence of the PO4 and VO4 groups and the absence of <e2>condensed phosphates and vanadates</e2> .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	Details of crystal structure determination for the end member x = 0 at room temperature ( in the rhombohedral phase ) and descriptions of <e1>low temperature</e1> <e2>monoclinic phase</e2> will be published elsewhere .

Condition-On(e1,e2)	As there is no significant <e1>absorption band</e1> at about 1600 cm -1 where one would expect a vibration frequency of water , we conclude that the observed vibration band is with high probability caused by <e2>O-H</e2> defects in the crystal structure ; this kind of defects is well known in natural quartz ( 7 ) .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Finally , from our recent <e1>crystal structure</e1> determination of the NASICON ( 14 ) , we have detected a new <e2>sodium position</e2> ( mid-Na ) in the conduction channel , intermediate between the usual Na ( l ) and Na(2) sites .
Feature-Of(e1,e2)	Their high stability and ability to incorporate wide variety of different <e1>cations</e1> in the <e2>crystal structure</e2> are the reasons of which these substances are proposed as the hosts for immobilizing radioactive wastes .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	In general , the properties of the <e1>NASICON type Na+ ion conductor</e1> compounds strongly depend upon the chemical stoichiometry , the crystal structure and <e2>unit cell parameters</e2> , that , at the same time , depend on the ionic radii of the cations located in octahedral(M) and tetrahedral(X) sites .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Physical and <e1>chemical properties</e1> of all these types of compounds depend strongly on their <e2>crystal structure</e2> .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	Depending on the composition , the <e1>crystal structure</e1> can either berhombohedral , monoclinic or <e2>triclinic</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	In general , <e1>phase transformations</e1> of this kind , where the high temperature phase is denser than the <e2>low temperature</e2> phase , are very rare .
Instance-Of(e1,e2)	The calcination at 800 <nUm> of the samples with compositions corresponding to x = 0.5 to 1.5 yields a NZP type <e1>phase</e1> as the major phase and SnP2O7 , TiP2O7 and unreacted <e2>SnO2</e2> as minor phases .
Other	It should be possible to extend the homogeneity range of this phase , and especially to increase the sodium content by electrochemical intercalation or by <e1>reaction</e1> with <e2>organometallic compounds</e2> .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The important advantage of such matrices compared to other candidate mineral - like matrices is ability to immobilize <e1>alkali metals</e1> in the <e2>insoluble</e2> phase .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	Both structures contain a rigid , three dimensional network of <e1>PO4</e1> or ( Si04 ) tetrahedra sharing corners with <e2>Zr06 octahedra</e2> and a three dimensionally linked interstitial space .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	In fact , for this special composition , we note that each Na ( l ) site is connected to <e1>Na(2) site triangles consisting</e1> on average of one <e2>vacant site</e2> and two filled sites .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The large thermal motion of Na(1) and <e1>Na(2)</e1> is probably related to the <e2>Na mobility</e2> in this structure .
Component-Whole(e1,e2)	The <e1>structure</e1> is formed by a three dimensional network of AsO4 tetrahedra and <e2>ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The global analysis of the structure at the four temperatures reveals that the <e1>structural transition</e1> is due to a fast rotation of the SnO6 and <e2>PO4 polyhedra</e2> around axes along the [0001] direction breaking the two fold axis in the R3c space group that exists in the structure above the transition point .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>PO4 polyhedra</e1> rotate strictly around the two fold axis in the high temperature phase , but around the [0001] direction in the <e2>low temperature</e2> form .
Other	The powder patterns of the three mixed <e1>sodium transition metal phosphates</e1> prepared within this study could all be interpreted assuming a <e2>hexagonal</e2> ( rhombohedral ) unit cell .
Other	The samples of the phosphates prepared , assigned to the rhombohedral and cubic structural modifications in accordance with the <e1>X-ray diffraction</e1> data , were also characterized by <e2>IR spectroscopy</e2> .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	The <e1>Na(l)</e1> position is localized at the intersection of three conduction channels , and this leads to a given Na(l) having six neighboring <e2>Na(2) positions</e2> distributed as two triplets at z 1 / 12 and rotated by Tt / 3 with respect to one another .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Therefore we deduce , that the Na2 <e1>occupancy</e1> increases with <e2>temperature</e2> at the expense of the interstitial sites ' occupancy because the Nal site is fully occupied at both temperatures .

Component-Whole(e2,e1)	An initial approach to correlate electrical parameters ( ionic conductivities and activation energies ) with generic average <e1>structural parameters</e1> ( <e2>unit cell constants</e2> ) was followed by scrutiny of specific structural factors such as the size of the bottleneck that connects the M1 and M2 sites .
Condition-On(e2,e1)	Long - range <e1>conduction</e1> of the ions in the NASICON structure involves hopping between the M1 and <e2>M2 sites</e2> .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	The interstitial voids generated within the network are of two types known as M1 and <e1>M2</e1> sites ( 1 : 3 multiplicity ) in the <e2>R3-c space group</e2> .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	In this skeleton , there are two <e1>sites</e1> , usually labeled M1 and <e2>M2</e2> .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	The M1 site is an antiprism formed by the triangular faces of two <e1>ABO6 octahedra</e1> along c axis of the <e2>hexagonal cell</e2> .

Located-Of(e1,e2)	After refinement of the framework atoms , the occupancy of the atomic positions Na(1) and <e1>Na(2)</e1> ( 6b and <e2>18e</e2> , respectively ) was refined but the obtained Na concentration in the structure model was lower than the Na content determined by ICP - OES .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In this model , it was assumed that the distances : RP1 , RP2 , RZ1 , RZ2 and DC would keep constant and that the equilibrium from the <e1>interatomic bonds</e1> would make any distortions in the <e2>octahedra</e2> and the tetrahedra proportional each other ( U ) with the residual effect ( T ) due to the fact that the structure can not be built by perfect octahedra and tetrahedra .
Condition-On(e1,e2)	The Na-O2 distance increases and the <e1>O2-Na-O2 angle</e1> decreases from <e2>65.6</e2> at 25 <nUm> to 63.4 <nUm> at 800 <nUm> , so the NaO6 octahedron distort more , away from 90 <nUm> , the angle of the perfect octahedron .
Method-Of(e1,e2)	The zirconium site occupancy could be completely accounted for as 1.66 Zr + 0.3 Na - 2 Kohler and Schulz ( 13 ) prepared single crystals from which they deduced a stoichiometry of <e1>Na3.lZrl.78Sil.24Pl.76012</e1> based upon X-ray refinement and the requirements of <e2>charge balance</e2> .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	No sodium atoms were included in the initial model and Zr / Sc and <e1>Si / P</e1> were assumed to be statistically distributed in their positional sites at full <e2>occupancy</e2> .

Feature-Of(e2,e1)	Among the different possible M3+ cations , scandium Sc3+ which exhibits the closest similarity with <e1>Zr4+</e1> ( empty <e2>d levels</e2> and essentially identical ionic radius ) is especially interesting and was consequently examined very early .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	For <e1>Na1+xZr2 - xInx(PO4)3</e1> series the same mechanism took place , but as In3+ is larger than Zr4+ the <e2>O(1)</e2> movement was not counteracted and a large a-axis increase was measured .
Component-Whole(e2,e1)	In the case of <e1>Sn4+</e1> , it is easier to bend the <e2>O-Sn-O</e2> and Sn-O-P bonds to get a somewhat closer packed structure below the transition point .

Feature-Of(e1,e2)	And so , the bigger rigidity of the <e1>O-M-O bond angles</e1> in the case of Ti4+ and Zr4+ than in the case of <e2>Sn4+</e2> , is the driving force that avoids the phase transition in the two first cases .

Instance-Of(e1,e2)	It appears that the oxygen oId belongs simultaneously to an octahedron <e1>TiO6</e1> and to a tetrahedron PO4 , while the oxygen O2a belongs to <e2>three polyhedra</e2> ( NaO6 , TiO6 and PO4 ) so it shows a lesser degree of freedom .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The <e1>bottleneck</e1> in the passageway from a Na 1 <e2>site</e2> to a Na 2 or Na 3 site is a puckered hexagonal ring having sides that alternate between octahedral and tetrahedral edges .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	Thus the geometrical features of the <e1>skeleton</e1> and its interstitial space satsify the criteria for fast Na+ ion transport , provided the site preference energy for a Na I position is not too much greater than those for <e2>Na 2 or Na 3 positions</e2> .
