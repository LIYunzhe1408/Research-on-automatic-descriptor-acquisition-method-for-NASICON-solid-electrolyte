Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The increase of the M1 site <e1>size</e1> in Na2SnFe(PO4)3 is accompanied by oxygen displacements perpendicular to the c axis which give rise to <e2>rotation</e2> of the PO4 tetrahedra and leads to a distortion of the [Sn(Fe)x(PO4)3] framework .

Hyponym-Of(e1,e2)	It should be noticed that within the Nasicon framework , there are four interconnected <e1>cation sites</e1> , usually labeled <e2>M1</e2> ( one per formula unit ) and M2 ( three per formula unit ) which can be represented by the crystallographic [M2]3[M]BB'(PO4)3 formula .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In the system Nal+xZr2Six P3 _xo 12 , on the Other hand , the introduction of excess Na ions introduces electrostatic <e1>Na+</e1> - Na+ <e2>interactions</e2> that can lower the activation energy even though transport must be via a Nal site .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In the system Nal+xZr2Six P3 _xo 12 , on the Other hand , the introduction of excess Na ions introduces electrostatic <e1>Na+</e1> - Na+ interactions that can lower the <e2>activation energy</e2> even though transport must be via a Nal site .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	However , with respect to the <e1>larger ion size</e1> of Na ( compared with zrk+ ) it seems less probable that Na+ occupies these <e2>interstitial sites</e2> because they are not located in the center of the coordination octahedron ( TABLE Il ) .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>rotation</e1> also causes the windows along likely <e2>diffusion paths</e2> to increase to a maximum size , close to the ionic radius of Na+ , near x = 2 .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	As previously observed by Hong ( 1 ) , the a <e1>hexagonal lattice constant</e1> monotonically increases with the <e2>progressive substitution</e2> of Si for P ions and insertion of Na+ .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Na+ <e1>interactions</e1> and thermal motion make all the Na sites average positions with a large <e2>Debye Waller factor</e2> , and ( 3 ) the network , though distorted and enlarged relative to NaZrP3O12 , remains intact .
Method-Of(e1,e2)	<e1>Conductivity measurements</e1> in the range 30-350 <nUm> reveal an activation energy of <e2>0.3 eV</e2> for Na+ conduction but conductivity values were found to change with temperature of sample preparation .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This <e1>substitution</e1> allows the <e2>P / Si ratio</e2> to vary independently of the Na+ concentration but as there is no concomitant substitution of Na+ in the Zr / Sc site ( vide infra ) the Sc substituted NASICONS are stoichiometric .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In earlier structural studies it was shown that Na+ - Na+ <e1>repulsions</e1> play an important role in how the <e2>cavities</e2> fill , thereby affecting the resultant conductivity .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Indeed , we believe that in <e1>substituting</e1> for Zr4 + the Sc3 + precludes Na+ from <e2>occupying</e2> these sites .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The resulting <e1>bottleneck</e1> sizes are small for Na+ <e2>hopping</e2> but it may be suitable for the Li+ cations .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The resulting <e1>bottleneck</e1> sizes are small for Na+ hopping but it may be suitable for the <e2>Li+ cations</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	However , the major reason for the <e1>low zirconium content</e1> is that about 0.3 mole of <e2>Na+</e2> was found in the zirconium positions .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	We would suggest that 0.22 Na+ are located in the <e1>Zr sites</e1> accompanied by some oxygen deficiency to account for under occupancy of the <e2>Na+ sites</e2> and a higher silicon content .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Regrinding and <e1>reheating</e1> the mix results in very slow <e2>incorporation</e2> of the free ZrO2 , probably by replacement of Na+ from the zirconium sites .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	It would appear that the stoichiometric compositions observed in the scandium substituted NASlCONs results from the <e1>Sc3+</e1> occupying <e2>Zr4+ sites</e2> and effectively excluding Na+ from doing so .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	<e1>Replacing Na</e1> with a large cation caused the dimension of <e2>the rhombohedral cell</e2> to increase but anomalously the a dimension decreased .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In the spectra of aluminum- and chromium containing phosphates Na2<e1>Al</e1>3/2Ta1/2(PO4)3 and Na2Cr3/2Ta1/2(PO4)3 , the bands of <e2>asymmetric stretching vibrations</e2> are blue - shifted owing to the smaller sizes of Al and Cr cations .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	The non-incorporated <e1>Al</e1> is present in the <e2>crystalline side phases</e2> ( f.i. AlPO4 ) and in an amorphous fraction ( likely sodium aluminate and sodium aluminum phosphate ) .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	The <e1>ionic radius</e1> of Al3z ( 0.535 A ) is smaller than that of Ti4z ( 0.605 A ) which explains the <e2>volume contraction</e2> with Al .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	The extra <e1>Na content</e1> , to compensate the Ti substitution by Al , was placed in the <e2>M2 site</e2> .

Method-Of(e1,e2)	High pressure <e1>X-ray diffraction</e1> studies on RbTi2(PO4)3 which is isostructural to NaZr2(PO4)3 showed a subtle reversible <e2>phase transition</e2> to R3 symmetry around 1.7 GPa that was attributed to distortion of polyhedra and collapse of cavities around Rb cations .

Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	Hence the effect of <e1>pressure</e1> on <e2>NaZr2(PO4)3</e2> is found to be primarily due to the size of alkali cation .

Method-Of(e1,e2)	<e1>Raman spectra</e1> of <e2>NaZr2(PO4)3</e2> and NaZr2(AsO4)3 .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	When X is <e1>As</e1> , <e2>the lengths of the O-O tetrahedron edges</e2> increase , consequently the cell parameters of NaZr2(AsO4)3 are superior to those of NaZr2(PO4)3 .
Hyponym-Of(e2,e1)	The value of <e1>3.2 g / cm</e1> for the <e2>density</e2> of NaZr2(PO4)3 found from the apparent loss of weight in benzene , corresponds to six formula units in the unit cell ( Qcalc = 3.18 g / cm3 ).
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Apparently , the usability of NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaZr2(PO4)3 compounds to build ceramics with very <e1>low thermal expansion</e1> lies not only in the <e2>topology of bonds</e2> in the NZP structure , but also in the relative rigidity of the O-M-O bond angles , to prevent the skeleton to distort and become closer packed .
Other	Both phases above and below the transition point are rhombohedral and , as the <e1>lattice thermal expansion of the high temperature phase</e1> is like those of <e2>NaTi2(PO4)3</e2> and NaZr2(PO4)3 , it has been suggested that these three phases are isostructural ( 1 ) , with NZP structure ( 2 ) .

Located-Of(e2,e1)	In the high temperature form , the <e1>two-fold axes</e1> [2110] fix the possible rotation of the <e2>phosphate groups</e2> to such axes , but in the low temperature form , there is no restriction and the rotation of the O21 - O22 edge has a component around the [0001] direction nine times bigger than the component around the [2110] direction ( the only rotation present in the NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaZr2(PO4)3 compounds ) .
Hyponym-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>NaZr2(PO4)3</e1> type structure ( NZP ) is formed by an extraordinary range of discrete compositions and <e2>crystalline solutions</e2> ( 1 ) .

Condition-On(e1,e2)	Both <e1>rhombohedral and cubic modifications</e1> are observed in phosphates containing cations in the oxidation states from <e2>+ 4</e2> to + 1 .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This weak effect is due to the fact that the <e1>covalent chemical bonds</e1> in the framework are far stronger than <e2>the bonds formed by the extraframework cations</e2> .
Hyponym-Of(e1,e2)	The <e1>NZP structure</e1> is distinguished by its <e2>high isomorphic capacity</e2> for different types of cations with different sizes and oxidation numbers : cations , either individually or in combinations , can occupy the framework and extraframework positions .
Hyponym-Of(e1,e2)	The basic <e1>framework</e1> of NZP accepts cations of different sizes and <e2>oxidation states</e2> to form solid solutions with the overall geometry retained .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	It might be expected that compositions with cations of a similar size have a <e1>higher conductivity</e1> than those which contain cations of very <e2>different sizes</e2> due to the different Coulombic and steric interactions along the conduction pathway .

Located-Of(e2,e1)	Aggregation of polyhedra into a <e1>3D framework</e1> occurs in both cases by <e2>sharing terminal oxygen atoms of neighboring dimers</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	In general , cations with <e1>smaller radii</e1> pull the <e2>electron density</e2> away from oxygen atoms more effectively , leaving the phosphorus atoms more positively charged .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	This is due to the fact that in the NZP type framework structure , the <e1>M+ cation</e1> is located within infinite columns of the <e2>ZrO6 octahedra</e2> and (P,V)O4 tetrahedra , which are combined through common oxygen atoms and are parallel to axis 3 ( axis of the unit cell ) .

Located-Of(e1,e2)	A second <e1>Na site</e1> ( Na2 , in Fig1. signed ) is coordinated by a <e2>wide cage</e2> of 8 oxygen atoms .
Cause-Effect(e1,e2)	This is obviously the normal consequence of the presence of a partially occupied site because vacant <e1>cationic sites</e1> can be equated to negative charges which repulse surrounding <e2>oxygen atoms</e2> .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	The low <e1>activation energy</e1> of alumina may be at least partly due to the fact that all the oxygen atoms neighboring the <e2>alkali ions</e2> , except those in sites 2c of space group P63 / mmc , are bonded by three aluminum atoms that polarize the O = ion charge density away from the alkali ion .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	It is also octahedrally coordinated by <e1>6Na2(rhomb)</e1> = 2Na2(mono) + 4Na3(mono) sites located in the same <e2>rhombohedral</e2> basal plane as the nearest neighbor oxygen atoms .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	It is also octahedrally coordinated by 6Na2(rhomb) = <e1>2Na2(mono)</e1> + 4Na3(mono) sites located in the same <e2>rhombohedral</e2> basal plane as the nearest neighbor oxygen atoms .

Hyponym-Of(e1,e2)	Since each 18 fold position adjoins two sixfold positions , the <e1>structural fragment</e1> of two sodium atoms and four oxygen atoms , multiplied by the symmetry elements , produces <e2>three dimensional infinite channels</e2> in the crystal .
Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	From an analysis of the interatomic distances in NZP phosphates of titanium and alkali metals , it is evident that the framework cation oxygen <e1>bond lengths</e1> are only weakly affected by the extraframework <e2>cation radius</e2> .
Other	The lower electrical conductivity of the A0.5A'0.5 Ti2(PO4)3 phosphates compared to the classical NASICON ionic conductors is likely due to the <e1>low concentration</e1> of <e2>mobile ions</e2> in the interstices and the smaller interstice sizes in the titanium - containing framework than in the zirconium compounds .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Therefore , it is reasonable to think that the move of sodium ions into the interstitial <e1>mid-Na position</e1> results from the increase of the <e2>interionic repulsions</e2> between Na ( l ) and Na(2) ions .

Component-Whole(e1,e2)	As a result , we may have captured in progress a redistribution of the sodium ions , involving a splitting apart of the <e1>Na(2 ) site</e1> , which is more completely realized in <e2>Na3Zr2Si2PO12</e2> .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	Each <e1>sixfold position</e1> occupied by a sodium ion of the second kind is surrounded by six 18 fold positions occupied by <e2>sodium ions</e2> of the first kind ; these positions are situated at the vertices of a trigonal anti prism , but the actual movement of the sodium ions takes place not along a straight line but as it were along the sand glass shape formed .
Feature-Of(e2,e1)	The first phase transformation , associated with a redistribution of the sodium ions , for <e1>Na3Sc2 (PO4)3</e1> crystals is characterized by a decrease in the <e2>unit cell volume</e2> , that is , by an increase in the density of the crystals from 2.81 g / cm3 ( 27<nUm> ) for the monoclinic modification to 2.88 g / cm 3 ( 65 <nUm> ) for the rhombohedra 1 modification .
Located-Of(e1,e2)	NaZr2(PO4)3 crystals , which have the same structure as Na3Sc2(PO4)3 , do not show the properties of the super ion state , but the introduction of additional <e1>sodium ions</e1> in the <e2>18 fold crystallographic position</e2> , including them in the overall system of sodium ions determining .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	Therefore , it is reasonable to think that the move of sodium ions into the interstitial <e1>mid-Na position</e1> results from the increase of the <e2>interionic repulsions</e2> between Na(1) and Na(2) ions .
Located-Of(e2,e1)	This is in agreement with a description in terms of a lattice of <e1>PO4 tetrahedra</e1> in which scandium and <e2>sodium ions</e2> occupy only vacant cavities between tetrahedra but do not contribute to the structural modifications .

Cause-Effect(e2,e1)	In some photomicrographs ( Fig. 1 ) , one can see ZrO2 grains that are brighter than the major mate rial ; this attests to substitution of Zn for minor amounts of Zr in the <e1>vanadate phosphate</e1> structure due to the use of <e2>ZnO</e2> additive .
